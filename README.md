# Recommender-system-for-personalized-financial-advice
A recommender system for personalized financial advice utilizes algorithms to analyze user data and preferences, offering tailored recommendations for investments, budgeting, and financial products. It continually refines suggestions through machine learning, aligning with individual goals and risk tolerance for optimized financial management.

Finance Data Analysis and Investment Recommendation
This repository contains Python code for analyzing finance-related data and providing investment recommendations based on machine learning models.

Overview
In this project, we aim to analyze a finance dataset to understand various factors influencing investment decisions and provide personalized investment recommendations. The dataset comprises information such as age, income, risk tolerance level, investment preferences, objectives, and savings goals of individuals.

Dataset
The dataset used for analysis is stored in a CSV file named Finance_data.csv. It includes both numerical and categorical variables related to finance and investment.

Analysis and Preprocessing
We begin by loading the dataset using the Pandas library and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the distribution of numerical and categorical variables. Missing values are handled appropriately using techniques such as imputation, and categorical variables are encoded for further analysis. Numerical features are normalized to ensure consistent scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory data analysis helps us visualize the distribution of variables and identify trends, patterns, and correlations within the data. We utilize Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to create histograms, count plots, pair plots, and scatter plots to explore relationships between variables and investment outcomes.

Machine Learning Model
We deploy a machine learning model, specifically a Random Forest classifier, to predict suitable investment types based on individual profiles and preferences. The model is trained on the processed dataset, and predictions are made using input data provided by the user.

Usage
To use the investment recommendation system:

Provide input data containing personal information, investment preferences, and objectives.
Call the predict_investment() function with the input data to get recommended investment options.
